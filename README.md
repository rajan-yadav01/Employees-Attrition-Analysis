# Employees-Attrition-Analysis
🚀 Exciting Project Completion!🚀

I’m thrilled to share that I have just completed my fourth project during my data analysis internship at Unified Mentor Private Limited . 🎉 This project, titled "Employees Attrition Analysis", was both challenging and rewarding.

📊 Project Brief: Green Destinations

Client: Green Destinations, a leading travel agency

Objective: To analyze and understand the increasing employee attrition rate. The HR Director at Green Destinations wanted to identify trends or patterns related to employees leaving the company. The focus was on determining:

- The attrition rate (percentage of employees who have left)
- The impact of factors such as age, years at the company, and income on employee retention

🔍 Key Insights:

1. Attrition Rate: Calculated the percentage of employees who have left, providing a clear picture of the current situation.
2. Factors Influencing Attrition: Analyzed how age, tenure, and income levels impact the likelihood of employees leaving. 

This analysis not only highlights critical trends but also provides actionable insights for improving employee retention strategies at Green Destinations.

A huge thank you to the team at Unified Mentor for their support and guidance throughout this project. 🙏

Looking forward to applying these insights and continuing to explore the fascinating world of data analysis! 🌟
